        <h2>Section 2.1: Summary - Offical Canvas Timeline® Deployment</h2>
        <p>
          Official Canvas Timeline® deployments are run with privacy in mind.
          <b
            >We do temporarily collect and retain some PII such as IP addresses used to access
            the official Canvas Timeline® deployment, but this is not intentional.</b

        <h2>Section 2.2: Summary - Unofficial Canvas Timeline® Deployments</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Canvas Timeline® developers are commited to ensuring Canvas Timeline® remains as a secure
            application. However, we cannot guarantee the same level of security or privacy of
            unofficial Canvas Timeline® deployments.
          </li>
          <li>
            The type of information collected on community deployments is completely dependent
            on who and where the deployment is being hosted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Generally, we recommend Canvas Timeline® deployment operators to collect as minimal
            information as possible.
          </li>
          <li>We cannot control unofficial Canvas Timeline® deployments.</li>
          <li>
            We cannot verify the authenticity of the code in unofficial Canvas Timeline®
            deployments. This is an extremely rare situation, but we will not be held
            responsible if your data such as an account becomes compromised as a result of
            malicious code in an unofficial Canvas Timeline® deployment.

        <h2>Section 4.1: The official Canvas Timeline® deployment</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Information that may be unintentionally collected as part of using Canvas Timeline®'s
            official deployment may include basic information such as your IP address, web
            traffic when using Canvas Timeline®, etc. This information is temporary and is kept
            until the server is rebooted.
          </li>
          <li>
            We do not purposefully collect anyone's information. We try to limit the data
            collected by the official Canvas Timeline® deployment.
          </li>
          <li>
            We do not, will not, and will never knowingly collect the information of minors
            under the age of 13 (or the minimum age required by laws in your country).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Section 4.2: Unofficial Canvas Timeline® Deployments</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We can't give a definitive answer on what information is collected when you use a
            unofficial Canvas Timeline® deployment, only the operator of the Canvas Timeline®
            deployment you're using can.
          </li>
          <li>
            We urge operators to collect and store as minimal information as possible, but we
            can't control what they do.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Section 5: Control</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We do not have the power to control what unofficial Canvas Timeline® deployment
            operators do with their deployment.
          </li>
          <li>
            We protect information stored on the official Canvas Timeline® deployment by limiting
            access. The only person that has access to the server of which the official
            Canvas Timeline® deployment runs on is the server host and the owner of Canvas Timeline®,
            xbubbo.
          </li>
          <li>
            We cannot check every deployment for malicious code. If any data such as your
            account gets compromised after you access it on a unofficial Canvas Timeline®
            deployment, we will not be held liable.

          Section 6: How we use basic information on the official Canvas Timeline® deployment that
          may be collected accidentally
        </h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your IP address is used to allow you to use the Canvas Timeline® service. This is how
            it works for every website you visit, not just Canvas Timeline®. The difference is
            whether or not this data is intentionally collected and stored.
          </li>
          <li>
            Info about your web traffic while using Canvas Timeline® is needed to allow you to
            access the service you wish to access.
          </li>
          <li>
            Canvas Timeline® will NEVER sell your info to third-parties, other than to some ad
            companies. We do this so we can make enough money to pay for our server.
